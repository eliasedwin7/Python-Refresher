---

## ‚úÖ What Is UML?

UML is a **visual language** used to **model the structure and behavior** of software systems. It helps teams **communicate system design** clearly.

---

## üß± Two Major Types of UML Diagrams

| Type           | Purpose                 | Examples                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Structural** | How the system is built | Class, Object, Component     |
| **Behavioral** | How the system behaves  | Use Case, Sequence, Activity |

---

## üîπ Key UML Diagram Types (You Should Know)

---

### 1. üßç Use Case Diagram (Behavioral)

* Shows **system features** from a **user‚Äôs perspective**
* Actors + Use Cases + System Boundary

```text
[User] ‚Üí (Login)
        ‚Üí (Reset Password)
```

---

### 2. üß© Class Diagram (Structural)

* Shows **classes**, their **attributes**, methods, and **relationships**
* Useful for understanding code structure

```text
+ User
  - name: string
  - login(): bool
```

üß¨ Relationships:

* Inheritance: `Admin` ‚Üí `User`
* Association: `User` has `Order`

---

### 3. ‚õì Sequence Diagram (Behavioral)

* Models the **interaction between objects over time**
* Vertical = time, Horizontal = objects

```text
User ‚Üí LoginService: enter credentials
LoginService ‚Üí DB: validate
DB ‚Üí LoginService: result
LoginService ‚Üí User: success/failure
```

---

### 4. üîÑ Activity Diagram (Behavioral)

* Like a flowchart, shows **workflow**
* Great for test case planning

```text
[Start] ‚Üí [Check Login] ‚Üí Decision ‚ßà (Valid?)
         ‚Üí [Retry] or [Dashboard] ‚Üí [End]
```

---

### 5. üîó Component Diagram (Structural)

* Shows system parts (modules/services)
* Useful for microservices or architecture docs

```text
[User Interface] ‚Üí [Auth Service] ‚Üí [Database]
```

## üìå UML in Testing

| Use Case                         | UML Diagram        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Mapping features to user actions | Use Case           |
| Designing test flows             | Activity, Sequence |
| Understanding class logic        | Class Diagram      |
| Test automation flow             | Sequence, Activity |

---

## üí¨ Interview Insight

> ‚ÄúWhy is UML useful in QA?‚Äù
> Helps in **understanding system flow**, designing **better test cases**, and **tracing requirements** visually.

> ‚ÄúWhich diagram is best for business logic testing?‚Äù
> **Activity Diagram** ‚Äî it shows conditional flows and steps clearly.

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon S3 Interview Prep (Theory)

---

## üìå What is Amazon S3?

* **S3 = Simple Storage Service**
* It is a **scalable, durable, object-based storage service** by AWS.
* You can store **any amount of data**, such as files, logs, media, backups, etc.

---

## üì¶ Key Concepts

| Term                    | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bucket**              | A container for storing files (objects). Unique across AWS globally. |
| **Object**              | A single file in S3. Includes data + metadata.                       |
| **Key**                 | The unique name (or full path) of an object in a bucket.             |
| **Region**              | Physical AWS data center location where your S3 bucket resides.      |
| **Storage Class**       | Controls cost/durability/access speed (e.g., Standard, Glacier, IA). |
| **ACL / Bucket Policy** | Used for access control ‚Äî who can access and what operations.        |

---

## üîê Access Control & Security

1. **Bucket Policies** ‚Äì JSON-based rules at the bucket level
2. **IAM Policies** ‚Äì Set user or role-based permissions
3. **ACLs** ‚Äì Legacy way to manage object-level permissions
4. **Encryption**

   * SSE-S3 (server-side, AWS-managed keys)
   * SSE-KMS (server-side, customer-managed keys)
   * Client-side encryption (done before upload)

---

## üìä S3 Use Cases

* Static website hosting
* Backup and restore
* Software distribution
* Media storage
* Data lake for analytics
* CI/CD artifact storage

---

## üí¨ Common Interview Questions & Sample Answers

---

### ‚ùì 1. What‚Äôs the difference between S3 and EBS?

**Answer:**

* S3 is **object storage**, used for storing files like images, logs, etc.
* EBS is **block storage**, used for EC2 volumes (like a hard drive).

---

### ‚ùì 2. How is data secured in S3?

**Answer:**

* By default, everything is private.
* Access can be given using **IAM policies, bucket policies, or pre-signed URLs**.
* Data can be encrypted using SSE or KMS.
* Logging and versioning help track changes and access.

---

### ‚ùì 3. What is S3 versioning?

**Answer:**

* It stores **every version** of every object.
* Helps in recovery after accidental deletes or overwrites.
* Cannot be disabled once enabled (only suspended).

---

### ‚ùì 4. What is the difference between S3 Standard and S3 Glacier?

**Answer:**

| S3 Standard     | S3 Glacier                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Frequent access | Long-term archival             |
| Fast access     | Slower retrieval (minutes‚Äìhrs) |
| Higher cost     | Lower storage cost             |

---

### ‚ùì 5. What are pre-signed URLs?

**Answer:**

* URLs that allow temporary, secure access to a private object.
* Often used to let someone download a file without making the bucket public.

| Availability    | 99.99% uptime                       |
| Unlimited Data  | Store from bytes to petabytes       |
| Global Access   | Access via HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere |

---

## üß† Tips for Interviews

* Focus on **use cases, security, and lifecycle management**.
* Emphasize **real-world usage** in CI/CD pipelines or test result archiving.
* Know basic differences between **S3 vs. EBS vs. EFS**.
