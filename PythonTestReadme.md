# Prepare for Interview

### 1. **Technical Round (Coding + Problem Solving)**
- Likely involves **Python** or **C++**.
- Expect questions on:
  - Data structures (lists, sets, dicts)
  - Algorithms (sorting, searching, string manipulation)
  - Scripting logic and writing clean, testable code
  - Test automation logic (unit tests, edge cases)

**Example**: Write a function that parses log files and detects anomalies.

### 2. **Testing Concepts + QA Focus**
- Strong focus on:
  - Manual vs automation testing
  - Writing test cases for complex scenarios
  - Test frameworks (PyTest, Selenium, etc.)
  - CI/CD pipeline exposure (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI)
  - API testing (Postman, requests module)
  - Linux commands and debugging logs

**Example**: Given a system log or API response, identify what test cases you’d write and how you'd automate them.

### 3. **System Design + Test Strategy**
- More high-level thinking:
  - How you’d test a trading engine or real-time data pipeline
  - Designing robust, scalable test strategies
  - Handling flaky tests, performance testing, mocking external systems

**Example**: Design a test framework for a stock ticker application that updates every second.

### 4. **Behavioral/Cultural Fit**
- SIG values:
  - Risk/reward decision-making
  - Clear communication
  - Fast learning & intellectual curiosity

Expect scenario-based questions like:
- Tell me about a time you caught a critical bug.
- How do you prioritize test cases in a tight release window?
- How do you handle failure or disagreement in a fast-paced team?
